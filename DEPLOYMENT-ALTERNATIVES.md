# Deployment Alternatives - NO CAPTCHA NEEDED

## Option 1: Formo.so Faucets ✅
- URL: https://formo.so/faucets
- Supports: Sepolia, Base, Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon
- Method: Try each testnet until one works
- Status: TRYING NOW

## Option 2: Remix VM (Sandbox) ✅
- Already works
- Good for: Testing, demo
- Bad for: Real hackathon submission (not real blockchain)

## Option 3: Deploy to Mainnet (Last Resort)
- Jonas' wallet likely has some ETH
- Deploy with minimal gas
- Real blockchain = real submission
- Cost: ~$5-20 in gas

## Decision Tree:
1. Try Formo.so faucets (all testnets) → 15 min
2. If all fail → Deploy to mainnet with Jonas' wallet
3. If mainnet blocked → Use Remix VM for demo + explain in submission

## Current Action: Testing Formo.so now
